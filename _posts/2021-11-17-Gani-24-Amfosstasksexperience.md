# My First Blog🥳

This will be my First Blog, and this will be about me and about my Experience while doing Amfoss tasks😎.




## 🚀 About Me
My name is Sai Ganesh K, I am from Bangalore,Karnataka.
I was very exicited to apply to Amfoss Club, cause i had read about the club in many socialmedia sites while researching about Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetam,Amritapuri.
I became intrigued about the club after learning how clubs work in Amrita and especially Amfoss.

The idea of all club members getting together and working on new things and learning new things really exited me, Because i wanted to explore new things in my 4 years of Engineering and there is no way better than being around with people of the club and sharing,learning and working on projects and other stuff together,which according to me is better than normal teaching.So with this view in mind i applied for amfoss tasks and i am really happy i did🤗.


## My Experience

- To be honest, I was a little skeptical about myself, whether ill be able to do the tasks, cause even though i had exposure to other coding languages, i had lost touch with them.But as i started doing the tasks, i was able to learn new things.

   I didnt have much idea about github and other stuff when i started doing the tasks, but looking at myself now, i can tell i have been able to learn a lot of things from these tasks.
- Where can i start😬, the tasks were really amazing, they covered many topics and i was able to grasp so much knowledge about so many new things from completing the tasks.
- Initially Every task felt hard, but as you start researching about how to approach it, how to handle it, how to tackle it, you will start to realize "I can do this task"😍.According to me that was the beauty of these tasks,it helped me understand, i can also learn new things and gain knowledge from it. 
- Overall all the tasks were amazing, nothing was simple to approach, but also nothing was too hard to approach as well. *I really had an amazing time doing this tasks, learning from them and it was a FUN Experience*🤪.
- The mentors assigned to me were very helpful, there were damn friendly and would reply almost immediately on my queries, let it be small or big. It was a great Experience working with them.

## Conclusion

   Applying for amfoss was a very good decision for me, cause i probably woudnt approach the things on my own that i approached due to the tasks, and this really makes me happy.I am thankful for my mentors again and all the people who were into creating these amazing set of tasks, i know creating them woudnt be so easy😄.Hattsoff to them
